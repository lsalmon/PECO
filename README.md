# UPDATE
It saddens us to say that Project PECO has been officially cancelled. The remaining member(s) simply don't have enough time to work on this, and there aren't enough members and skillsets available to continue.

There are no plans to bring back the project with the original team, but feel free to fork the repo yourself or come chat with us on the <em>New Game!</em> Discord server linked below.

# Project PECO
Project PECO is a prototype/recreation of the video game PECO from season 2 of the anime <em>New Game!</em>, being developed in Unity by members of the <em>New Game!</em> Discord server.

### Design Doc 
The design document is no longer publicly available.

### Helping Out
Even though the project is cancelled, we'd still love to chat! Come talk about this project, the anime, or anything else!
